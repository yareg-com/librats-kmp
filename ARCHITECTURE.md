# librats Architecture

librats is a high-performance C++17 peer-to-peer networking library. It gives you
encrypted P2P connections, peer discovery (DHT, mDNS), NAT traversal, pub/sub
messaging, file transfer and more — exposed to C++, C, Node.js, Java, Python and
Android. This document explains the *shape* of the system: the layers, the key
classes, the threading model, and the one design rule that everything else
follows.

## 1. The one big idea

**The `Node` core is small and feature-agnostic. Every capability is an opt-in
`Subsystem` that you attach before you start.**

A bare `Node`, out of the box, is *only*:

- an **encrypted TCP transport** (Noise_XX) with a **self-certifying identity**,
- **manual dialing** (`connect(host, port)`) — it never finds peers on its own,
- a **peer table** with an admission limit,
- **raw channel messaging** (`send` / `broadcast` / `on("channel", …)`),
- connect/disconnect events and two small coordination buses.

That's it. DHT discovery, mDNS, GossipSub pub/sub, file transfer, ping/liveness,
NAT port mapping, automatic reconnection, peer exchange, typed JSON messaging,
distributed storage — **all of these are subsystems you add explicitly**:

```cpp
librats::NodeConfig config;
config.listen_port = 8080;
librats::Node node(config);

node.add_subsystem(std::make_unique<librats::PubSub>());            // pub/sub
node.add_subsystem(std::make_unique<librats::DhtDiscovery>(dht));   // discovery

node.start();   // attach BEFORE this line
```

Why build it this way? Because it keeps `Node` from becoming a god-class that
every feature reaches into. The core stays tiny and predictable, you pay only for
what you attach, and each feature can be developed, tested and reasoned about in
isolation. A subsystem never holds a `Node&` and is never a `friend` of `Node`;
it reaches the rest of the system only through three narrow interfaces (described
in [§5](#5-the-subsystem-contract)). If you remember nothing else from this
document, remember this paragraph.

## 2. A 60-second mental model

Think of librats as a stack of layers. Each layer only knows about the one below
it, and each is replaceable behind an interface.

```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  Your application  /  C ABI  /  Node.js · Java · Python · …   │
   ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │  Subsystems (opt-in plugins)                                  │
   │    DhtDiscovery · MdnsDiscovery · PubSub · FileTransfer ·     │
   │    PingService · PortMappingService · ReconnectionService ·  │
   │    PeerExchange · MessageJson · StorageManager · Bittorrent   │
   ├───────────────┬─────────────────┬───────────────────────────┤
   │  ctx.network  │   ctx.events    │      ctx.services          │  ← the 3 contracts
   │ (PeerNetwork) │   (EventBus)    │   (ServiceRegistry)        │
   ├───────────────┴─────────────────┴───────────────────────────┤
   │  Node  — the thin facade that wires everything together       │
   ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │  Wire      : two-level framing + MessageRouter                │
   │  Security  : Identity · Handshaker · Session (Noise_XX)       │
   │  Transport : ReactorPool → Reactor(s) → Connection(s)         │
   │  Core      : sockets · IOPoller (epoll/kqueue/IOCP) · buffers │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Data flows up and down this stack. Bytes arrive on a socket → a `Connection`
decrypts and parses them into a `Frame` → the `MessageRouter` dispatches the frame
to whichever subsystem (or application handler) owns it. Sending runs the same
path in reverse.

---

## 3. Hello, librats (a real example)

This is taken almost verbatim from the test suite — two nodes, one channel, an
encrypted echo:

```cpp
Node server(server_config());
Node client(client_config());          // client: enable_listen = false (dial-only)

// The server echoes whatever arrives on the "chat" channel back to the sender.
server.on("chat", [](const Peer& from, ByteView msg) {
    from.send("chat", msg);
});

client.on("chat", [](const Peer&, ByteView msg) {
    /* got the echo */
});

server.start();
client.start();

client.connect("127.0.0.1", server.listen_port());   // non-blocking dial
// ... once connected ...
client.send(server.local_id(), "chat", ByteView(std::string("hello node")));
```

Things to notice, because they are true everywhere in librats:

- **`connect` / `send` / `broadcast` are non-blocking and thread-safe.** They post
  work to the owning reactor and return immediately.
- **Handlers run on a reactor thread**, so you register them *before* `start()`.
- **A `Peer` handle is the reply path.** `from.send(...)` inside a handler reaches
  the right connection directly — no lookup, no peer id needed.
- The whole exchange is **encrypted end-to-end** and both sides have
  cryptographically **authenticated each other's identity** by the time the
  connection is up.

---

## 4. The layers, bottom to top

### 4.1 Core primitives

`src/librats/core/` is the foundation — small, dependency-free building blocks:

| Piece | Role |
|-------|------|
| `socket.h` | Thin cross-platform TCP/UDP socket wrappers. |
| `io_poller.h` | **The platform abstraction.** One interface over `epoll` (Linux), `kqueue` (macOS/BSD) and `IOCP` (Windows). Everything above it is platform-independent. |
| `bytes.h` | `Bytes` (owning buffer) and `ByteView` (non-owning span). `ByteView` is how librats passes payloads around **without copying**. |
| `receive_buffer.h` / `chained_send_buffer.h` | Per-connection RX/TX buffers. The send buffer is a chain of chunks so a shared broadcast payload isn't re-copied per peer. |
| `mpsc_queue.h` | Lock-free multi-producer/single-consumer queue — the *only* way other threads hand work to a reactor. |
| `timer_queue.h` | Timers (handshake timeouts, backoff) that ride the reactor's poll loop. |
| `notifier.h` / `wakeup_pipe.h` | How you wake a reactor that is blocked in `poll()`. |
| `event_bus.h` / `service_registry.h` | The two node-wide coordination buses (see [§5](#5-the-subsystem-contract)). |

### 4.2 Transport: reactors & connections

This is the heart of librats' performance, and it rests on one invariant:

> **A `Connection` is owned by exactly one `Reactor` and is only ever touched by
> that reactor's thread. It holds no locks and no atomics.**

This is the *shared-nothing* model. Because a connection lives behind a single
thread, the hot data path — read, decrypt, parse, encrypt, write — never contends
on a lock.

**`Connection` (`src/librats/transport/connection.{h,cpp}`)** is a per-peer state machine:

```
   Connecting ──▶ Handshaking ──▶ Established ──▶ Closing ──▶ Closed
   (TCP connect)  (Noise / id)    (encrypted      (drain)
                                   frames flow)
```

- *Connecting* — an outbound TCP connect is in flight (inbound sockets skip this).
- *Handshaking* — a `Handshaker` runs to completion, producing a `Session` and the
  remote's authenticated `PeerId`.
- *Established* — inbound blocks are decrypted into frames and delivered; outbound
  frames are encrypted and queued.

The connection reports everything through a `ConnectionDelegate` (which `Node`
implements) and asks its reactor to arm/disarm write-interest — it never touches
the poller directly.

**`Reactor` (`src/librats/transport/reactor.{h,cpp}`)** runs one thread driving an
`IOPoller`. Other threads interact with it *only* through:

- `post(task)` — enqueue a closure and wake the loop (from any thread);
- `execute(task)` — same, but run inline if already on the reactor thread;
- convenience wrappers `connect()`, `close()`, `broadcast()`, `schedule()`.

The single synchronization point is the **MPSC task queue** plus a wakeup pipe to
break the `poll()` wait. There are no other locks on the data path.

**`ReactorPool` (`src/librats/transport/reactor_pool.h`)** owns N reactors
(`NodeConfig::reactor_threads`, default **1** — which is plenty for thousands of
peers). Larger pools shard *outbound* connections round-robin across cores; each
connection is pinned to its reactor for life, so nothing on the data path changes
as the pool grows. Reactor 0 is the acceptor for inbound connections.

**Backpressure & deadlines** — two safety limits live here:

- Each connection has an **8 MiB send high-water mark**
  (`kDefaultSendHighWater`). A peer that can't keep up and pushes the send buffer
  past it is dropped with `CloseReason::SlowConsumer` — a slow consumer can never
  make the node run out of memory.
- A **15-second establish deadline** covers connect + handshake combined; a peer
  that stalls the handshake is reaped.

### 4.3 The wire protocol

The wire is **two levels** (`src/librats/wire/frame.h`). Separating them keeps encryption
clean.

**Level 1 — the outer block.** Everything on the wire is a length-prefixed frame:

```
   ┌──────────────┬───────────────────────────┐
   │ length (u32) │            body            │   body ≤ 64 MiB (kMaxBlockSize)
   └──────────────┴───────────────────────────┘
```

The body is opaque at this layer. During the handshake it's a raw handshake
message; once established it's the **`Session`-encrypted** bytes of an inner
message.

**Level 2 — the inner message.** After decryption, the body is:

```
   ┌──────┬───────┬─────────┬───────────────┐
   │ type │ flags │ channel │   payload …   │
   │  u8  │  u8   │   u16   │               │
   └──────┴───────┴─────────┴───────────────┘
```

Because the cipher wraps the *whole* inner message (the `type` byte included), the
block layer never has to understand the message — it just moves opaque bytes.
Decoding is **zero-copy**: the parsed `ByteView` points straight into the receive
buffer.

**`MessageType` is how traffic is routed.** Each value is effectively owned by one
subsystem. When you add a subsystem that needs its own traffic, you add a value
here:

| `MessageType` | Owner |
|---------------|-------|
| `App` (1) | application channel messaging (`node.on("channel", …)`) |
| `Control` (2) | core control plane — including the `identify` exchange |
| `Gossip` (3) | `PubSub` (GossipSub) |
| `FileChunk` (4) | `FileTransfer` |
| `Ping` (5) | `PingService` |
| `Storage` (6) | `StorageManager` |
| `Typed` (7) | `MessageJson` |
| `Pex` (8) | `PeerExchange` |

**`MessageRouter` (`src/librats/wire/message_router.h`)** does the dispatch. Non-`App`
frames go to the handler registered for their `MessageType`. `App` frames are
dispatched by their **channel**: the channel *name* is hashed (FNV-1a) to a stable
16-bit id, so the same name maps to the same id on every node with no shared
registry. `node.on("chat", …)` is just `App` traffic with `channel = id("chat")`.

> Note: DHT and mDNS are *not* in this table. They run their own separate
> protocols (Kademlia/KRPC over UDP, multicast DNS) and don't use the node's TCP
> message bus at all — they only call `ctx.network.connect()` to feed discovered
> peers into the mesh.

### 4.4 Security: identity & handshake

Identity in librats is **self-certifying** — there is no PKI, no certificate
authority, no central registry.

- Every node has one static **Curve25519 keypair** (`Identity`, `security/identity.h`).
- Its **`PeerId` is the SHA-256 of its public key** (`peer/peer_id.h`).
- The Noise_XX handshake proves possession of the private key, so completing a
  handshake *proves* the remote's `PeerId`. Identity is cryptographically bound to
  the key and cannot be forged. (This is the same scheme libp2p uses.)

A `PeerId` is a cheap, hashable, ordered value type — it drops straight into an
`unordered_map` as a key.

Security is **pluggable** behind two interfaces (`security/handshaker.h`):

```
   SecurityProvider  ── create(role) ──▶  Handshaker  ── yields ──▶  Session
   (one per node:                          (one per                  (encrypt/
    keypair + policy)                       connection)               decrypt)
```

- A **`SecurityProvider`** holds the node's single keypair/policy and mints a fresh
  `Handshaker` for each new connection.
- A **`Handshaker`** is fed handshake blocks until it yields a `Session` + the
  remote `PeerId`, or fails. It is transport-agnostic — the `Connection` just
  shuttles its bytes.
- A **`Session`** (`security/session.h`) encrypts every outbound frame and
  decrypts every inbound one.

Swapping `NoiseSecurity` ⇄ `PlaintextSecurity` changes the entire security posture
without touching a line of transport code. Plaintext even supplies a *passthrough*
`Session`, so the `Connection`'s hot path is byte-for-byte identical whether or
not encryption is on — no `if (encrypted)` sprinkled through the code.

**Protocol binding.** Your app's protocol string (`NodeConfig::protocol`, e.g.
`"librats/1.0"`) is turned into a `protocol_id` blob and bound into the handshake
(as the Noise prologue). Two nodes whose protocol strings differ **cannot complete
a handshake** — a cheap, cryptographically enforced way to keep separate apps (or
app versions) from cross-connecting.

**Persistence.** Set `NodeConfig::data_dir` and the keypair is saved to
`identity.key`, giving the node a stable `PeerId` across restarts. Leave it empty
for an ephemeral identity (fresh random key each run).

### 4.5 Identify: learning dialable addresses

There's a subtle problem a raw TCP socket can't solve: when a peer *dials in*, the
socket only tells you its *source* endpoint — its IP plus an ephemeral, OS-chosen
port. That's not the port it *listens* on, so you can't dial it back.

librats fixes this with the **identify** exchange (`src/librats/node/identify.{h,cpp}`).
Right after the handshake, each side sends a `Control` message carrying:

- its **`listen_port`** and self-advertised dialable **`addresses`**, and
- the **`observed`** address it saw the *other* side connecting from.

The receiver pairs the sender's reported listen port with the IP it actually sees
them at → a reconnectable address. The `observed` field also lets a node learn its
own public IP (surfaced via `Node::observed_addresses()`). The decoder is fully
bounds-checked: a hostile or malformed payload yields nothing, never misbehavior.

### 4.6 The Node facade

**`Node` (`src/librats/node/node.{h,cpp}`)** is the public entry point, and it is
deliberately *thin*. It owns the moving parts and wires them together, but the
logic lives in the layers, not here. Concretely, `Node`:

- owns the `ReactorPool`, the `SecurityProvider`, the `PeerTable`, the
  `MessageRouter`, the `EventBus` and the `ServiceRegistry`;
- **is** the `ConnectionDelegate` the reactors report to (`on_established`,
  `on_frame`, `on_closed`, `admit_inbound`);
- **is** the `PeerNetwork` that subsystems are handed (see below);
- exposes the small async API: `connect`, `send`, `broadcast`, `on`,
  `on_peer_connected`, `peers`, `add_subsystem`, `start`, `stop`.

`Node` never grows feature logic. A new capability becomes a subsystem; `Node`'s
surface stays the same. That restraint is the whole point.

### 4.7 The peer directory

**`PeerTable` (`src/librats/peer/peer_table.h`)** maps `PeerId → route + metadata`. It is
the *only* shared peer structure, and it is deliberately kept **off the per-byte
data path**: it's touched on connect/disconnect and on explicit by-id lookups
(`send`-by-id, `peers()`), never per frame. So it's read-mostly and guarded by a
`shared_mutex` with short critical sections.

It also resolves **duplicate connections** deterministically. When two peers dial
each other at the same time (a cross-connect), both compute the *same* winner from
a symmetric rule over their ids (`prefer_outbound`), so both converge on a single
link and the loser is torn down.

**`Peer` (`src/librats/peer/peer.h`)** is the lightweight handle passed to your callbacks.
It carries the peer's `id` *and* its `route` (which reactor + which connection), so
`peer.send(...)` reaches the right reactor directly with **no table lookup on the
reply path**. `peer.info()` consults the directory only when you actually ask for
metadata.

---

## 5. The subsystem contract

A subsystem reaches the rest of the node through exactly **three** narrow
interfaces, bundled into a `NodeContext` (`src/librats/node/node_context.h`) it receives at
`attach()`:

```cpp
struct NodeContext {
    PeerNetwork&     network;   // talk to peers
    EventBus&        events;    // "something happened"  (one → many, no return)
    ServiceRegistry& services;  // "do X / give me Y"    (one → one, with return)
};
```

**Rule of thumb:**

| You want to… | Use |
|--------------|-----|
| send/broadcast/connect, react to peer up/down, claim a `MessageType` | `ctx.network` |
| announce a fact others may react to (e.g. the network changed) | `ctx.events` |
| call a specific capability on a sibling module (and get a value back) | `ctx.services` |

**`PeerNetwork` (`src/librats/node/peer_network.h`)** — the *entire* contract a subsystem
has with the network: `send` / `broadcast` / `connect`, `on(MessageType, handler)`,
`peers()`, `connected_peers()`, and the `on_peer_connected` / `on_peer_disconnected`
/ `on_dial_failed` hooks. This is also exactly what you **mock in tests** — a
subsystem is tested against a fake `PeerNetwork`, with no real sockets.

**`EventBus` (`src/librats/core/event_bus.h`)** — typed, fire-and-forget pub/sub. A
publisher emits a value; every subscriber for that type runs. The publisher
neither knows nor names its subscribers (which is what stops modules from grabbing
references to each other):

```cpp
ctx.events.on<NetworkChanged>([](const NetworkChanged& e){ /* re-announce */ });
// elsewhere:
ctx.events.emit(NetworkChanged{addrs});   // all subscribers run
```

**`ServiceRegistry` (`src/librats/core/service_registry.h`)** — the targeted, *with a
return value* half. A module registers itself under a narrow capability
*interface*; another module resolves that interface and calls it directly, yet
never depends on the concrete type. `get<I>()` returns `nullptr` when no provider
is present, so callers degrade gracefully when a module is disabled:

```cpp
// provider (in attach):   ctx.services.provide<DhtService>(this);
// consumer (in start):    if (auto* dht = ctx.services.get<DhtService>()) dht->client()...
```

**The `Subsystem` interface itself is just three calls:**

```cpp
class Subsystem {
    virtual void attach(NodeContext& ctx) = 0;  // wire up: subscribe / provide / on(type,…)
    virtual void start() = 0;                    // spin up threads, announce, etc.
    virtual void stop()  = 0;                    // tear down (called in reverse order)
};
```

Subscribe to events, provide services and register message handlers during
`attach()` — before any reactor runs. This is the same "configure before `start()`"
rule the whole node follows.

---

## 6. The subsystems

Everything below is opt-in. Attach only what you need.

| Subsystem | What it does | Talks via |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **`DhtDiscovery`** (`subsystems/dht_discovery.h`) | Peer discovery over a Kademlia DHT — announces the node's TCP port under a discovery hash and searches for peers, then dials them. Dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 (BEP 32). Compatible with the BitTorrent Mainline DHT. | own UDP/KRPC network; `network.connect()`; publishes `DhtService` |
| **`MdnsDiscovery`** (`subsystems/mdns_discovery.h`) | Local-network discovery via multicast DNS. Advertises the node as an mDNS service (named from its `PeerId`) and browses for the same service type, dialing what it finds. | multicast DNS; `network.connect()` |
| **`PubSub`** (`subsystems/pubsub.h`) | A full **GossipSub** implementation: topic-based publish/subscribe with a per-topic mesh, eager forwarding, and lazy-pull recovery (IHAVE/IWANT). Runs its own heartbeat thread. | owns `MessageType::Gossip` |
| **`FileTransfer`** (`subsystems/file_transfer.h`) | Bidirectional file/directory streaming with per-chunk CRC32 + whole-file SHA-256, backpressure, pause/resume/cancel, offer/accept, atomic finalize (temp file → rename). | owns `MessageType::FileChunk` |
| **`PingService`** (`subsystems/ping_service.h`) | Liveness + RTT: periodically pings peers, who echo back, measuring round-trip time. | owns `MessageType::Ping` |
| **`PortMappingService`** (`subsystems/port_mapping_service.h`) | Auto-forwards the listen port through the home router via **UPnP IGD** and **NAT-PMP** (both, in parallel). | NAT protocols; reads `listen_port()` |
| **`ReconnectionService`** (`subsystems/reconnection.h`) | Re-dials dropped peers with exponential backoff; optionally persists targets (via `PeerBook`) so they survive a restart. | `network.peers()` + `on_dial_failed`; `network.connect()` |
| **`PeerExchange`** (`subsystems/peer_exchange.h`) | Pull-only **PEX**: on connect, asks a peer for a random sample of *its* peers and dials the new ones. Grows the mesh organically; rate-limited to avoid dial storms. | owns `MessageType::Pex` |
| **`MessageJson`** (`subsystems/message_json.h`) | Familiar `on` / `once` / `off` / `send` API for **typed JSON** messages, named by a type string; the authenticated sender is the handshake `PeerId`. | owns `MessageType::Typed` |
| **`StorageManager`** (`subsystems/../storage/storage.h`) | Distributed key-value store with typed values, **Last-Write-Wins** conflict resolution and on-disk persistence. Re-floods only when LWW is won, so epidemics terminate. *(gated by `RATS_STORAGE`)* | owns `MessageType::Storage` |
| **`Bittorrent`** (`subsystems/bittorrent.h`) | BitTorrent client as a subsystem (magnets, torrent files, spider mode); can **share the node's DHT** instead of standing up a second one. *(gated by `RATS_SEARCH_FEATURES`)* | borrows `DhtService` |

Two of these illustrate the `ServiceRegistry` pattern nicely: `DhtDiscovery`
**provides** a `DhtService` (a handle to its DHT client), and `Bittorrent`
**resolves** it — so when both are attached, BitTorrent reuses the one DHT instead
of running its own. Disable `DhtDiscovery` and BitTorrent simply falls back; no
code changes, because the dependency is by interface and may be `nullptr`.

The only node-level event today is **`NetworkChanged`** (`src/librats/node/host_events.h`),
emitted (debounced) by the optional `NetworkMonitor` when the host's interfaces or
routes change — Wi-Fi↔cellular, VPN up/down, dock, wake-from-sleep. Long-lived
subsystems subscribe to it to renew port mappings and re-announce a public
endpoint that would otherwise go stale.

---

## 7. The threading model (read this twice)

Getting this right is the difference between code that works and code that
crashes under load. The rules:

1. **Every event callback runs on a reactor thread.** `on_peer_connected`,
   `on_peer_disconnected`, `on("channel", …)`, every `on(MessageType, …)` handler
   — all of them. So:
   - **Register them before `start()`.** After `start()` the reactors are live.
   - **Keep them non-blocking.** A handler that blocks stalls every other
     connection on that reactor. Offload heavy work to your subsystem's own thread.
   - **Don't assume which thread you're on** beyond "a reactor thread."

2. **`connect` / `send` / `broadcast` are non-blocking and thread-safe.** They post
   work to the owning reactor; you can call them from anywhere.

3. **Never touch a `Connection` from another thread.** It holds no locks precisely
   because only its reactor touches it. Cross-thread work enters a reactor *only*
   through `post()` / `execute()`.

4. **Don't add locks or blocking calls to the per-connection path.** The
   shared-nothing model is the performance story; honor it.

5. **A subsystem that needs to do periodic or blocking work runs its own thread**
   (PubSub's heartbeat, PingService's prober, ReconnectionService's redial loop,
   the NAT clients). They reach the network through the thread-safe `PeerNetwork`
   methods.

Where synchronization *does* exist, it's deliberate and narrow: the MPSC task
queue at the reactor boundary, the `shared_mutex` around the read-mostly
`PeerTable`, and the mutex inside the `EventBus`. None of it is on the per-byte
data path.

---

## 8. Lifecycle: attach → start → stop

```
   construct Node(config)         load identity, prepare layers — NO socket opened yet
        │
        ├─ add_subsystem(...)      attach order matters; returns a usable raw pointer
        ├─ on_peer_connected(...)  register callbacks
        ├─ on("channel", ...)
        │
   node.start()                    open listener → start reactor pool
        │                          → for each subsystem: attach(ctx) then start()
        │                          ── node is live; callbacks now fire ──
        │
   node.stop()                     stop subsystems in REVERSE attach order
                                   → close all connections → join reactors  (idempotent)
```

Two details that bite people:

- **Attach and register *before* `start()`.** Adding a subsystem or a handler after
  the reactors are running is a mistake (the C ABI even rejects it with
  `RATS_ERR_ALREADY_STARTED`).
- **Stop is reverse-order and idempotent.** Subsystems are torn down in the
  opposite of the order they were attached, so a dependency is never pulled out
  from under a dependent.

## 9. Language bindings

Everything non-C++ is built on one C ABI: **`src/librats/bindings/rats.{h,cpp}`**.

- A `rats_t` is an opaque pointer wrapping a C++ `Node`.
- **Subsystems are opt-in via `rats_enable_*()`** calls made *before*
  `rats_start()` — `rats_enable_dht`, `rats_enable_mdns`, `rats_enable_pubsub`,
  `rats_enable_json`, `rats_enable_file_transfer`, `rats_enable_ping`,
  `rats_enable_reconnect`, `rats_enable_port_mapping`. This mirrors C++'s
  `add_subsystem` exactly.
- **Error model:** fallible calls return a `rats_error_t` (`RATS_OK == 0`;
  non-zero is an error — e.g. `RATS_ERR_NOT_ENABLED`, `RATS_ERR_ALREADY_STARTED`).
  Pure getters return their value directly.
- **Threading is the same as C++:** callbacks fire on a reactor thread — don't
  block in them.

The Node.js (`nodejs/`), Java/Python (`bindings/`, `python/`) and Android
(`android/`) wrappers all sit on top of this C ABI. **The rule for contributors:**
when you add a public C++ capability that should be reachable from other languages,
surface it through this C API (typically as a `rats_enable_*` plus a few calls) and
keep the language wrappers in sync.

## 11. How to add a new feature

The architecture is at its best when you extend it the way it expects. To add a
capability, **write a `Subsystem`** — don't touch `Node`:

1. **Create `src/librats/subsystems/your_thing.{h,cpp}`** with a class deriving from
   `Subsystem` (implement `attach` / `start` / `stop`).
2. **If it needs its own peer traffic, add a `MessageType`** to the enum in
   `wire/frame.h` and claim it in `attach()` with
   `ctx.network.on(MessageType::YourThing, handler)`. If it only needs the existing
   discovery/dialing, you may not need a new type at all.
3. **Wire up coordination in `attach()`** — subscribe to events you care about
   (`ctx.events.on<...>`), and `provide<>` / `get<>` any capability interface you
   expose or depend on.
4. **Do heavy or periodic work on your own thread**, reaching peers through the
   thread-safe `PeerNetwork` methods. Keep reactor-thread callbacks short.
5. **Register the test:** add a `tests/test_your_thing.cpp` *and* list it in the
   appropriate `TEST_SOURCES` block in `CMakeLists.txt` (there is no glob). Test
   against a mock `PeerNetwork` — no real sockets needed.
6. **If it should be reachable from other languages**, surface it through the C ABI
   (`src/librats/bindings/rats.{h,cpp}`) as a `rats_enable_*` and keep the wrappers in sync.

What **not** to do: don't widen `Node`'s public surface, don't make a subsystem
hold a `Node&` or become its `friend`, and don't add locks to the per-connection
path. If you find yourself wanting to, the design is telling you the work belongs
behind one of the three contracts instead.

## 12. Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Node** | The thin facade and public entry point; owns the layers, exposes the small async API. |
| **Subsystem** | An opt-in plugin (DHT, PubSub, …) attached before `start()`; reaches the node only via `NodeContext`. |
| **NodeContext** | The bundle (`network`, `events`, `services`) a subsystem gets at `attach()`. |
| **PeerNetwork** | The narrow network contract subsystems use; `Node` implements it; tests mock it. |
| **EventBus** | Typed fire-and-forget pub/sub for "something happened" (one → many). |
| **ServiceRegistry** | Interface-keyed lookup for "do X / give me Y" (one → one, with a return value). |
| **Reactor** | A single thread driving an `IOPoller`, owning a shard of connections with no locks. |
| **ReactorPool** | The set of reactors; shards connections across cores (default 1). |
| **Connection** | Per-peer state machine (Connecting → … → Closed); touched only by its reactor's thread. |
| **Frame** | A decoded inner message: a `FrameHeader` (`type`, `flags`, `channel`) + payload view. |
| **MessageType** | The inner `type` byte that routes a frame to its owning subsystem. |
| **MessageRouter** | Dispatches frames — `App` by channel id, everything else by `MessageType`. |
| **PeerId** | A peer's identity: SHA-256 of its static public key; self-certifying, unforgeable. |
| **Identity** | A node's static keypair + derived `PeerId`; persisted to `identity.key` if `data_dir` set. |
| **SecurityProvider / Handshaker / Session** | The pluggable security stack: node policy → per-connection handshake → per-connection cipher. |
| **identify** | The post-handshake `Control` exchange that teaches peers each other's dialable address. |
| **PeerTable** | The control-plane directory (`PeerId → route + metadata`), kept off the data path. |
| **Peer** | A lightweight handle (id + route) passed to callbacks; the zero-lookup reply path. |
