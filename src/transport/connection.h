/**
 * @file connection.h
 * @brief A single peer connection: socket, secure-channel handshake, framing.
 *
 * A Connection is owned by exactly one Reactor and is only ever touched by that
 * reactor's thread. Because of that single-threaded ownership it holds NO locks
 * and uses NO atomics — all synchronisation lives at the reactor boundary (the
 * task queue). This is the heart of the shared-nothing model.
 *
 * Lifecycle: Connecting → Handshaking → Established → Closing/Closed.
 *   - Connecting:  outbound TCP connect in flight (inbound skips this).
 *   - Handshaking: a Handshaker (from the reactor's SecurityProvider) runs to
 *                  completion, yielding a Session and the remote PeerId.
 *   - Established: inbound blocks are decrypted into inner frames and delivered;
 *                  outbound frames are encrypted and queued.
 *
 * The Connection reports events through a ConnectionDelegate and asks the
 * Reactor to (dis)arm write-interest; it never touches the poller directly.
