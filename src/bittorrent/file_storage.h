/**
 * @file file_storage.h
 * @brief The file layout of a torrent and the piece <-> file mapping.
 *
 * A torrent's payload is one contiguous byte space: files are laid end-to-end
 * in order, each at a running @c offset. Pieces are fixed-size windows over that
 * space (the final piece is short). FileStorage answers the two questions the
 * disk and wire layers need: "how big is piece i?" and "which file regions does
 * a (piece, offset, length) range touch?". The latter (map_block) is O(log n)
 * via a binary search over the sorted file offsets.
