/**
 * @file chained_send_buffer.h
 * @brief Outbound byte queue: a chain of heap chunks drained with gather I/O.
 *
 * A socket accepts what it accepts; whatever is left over has to wait for the next
 * writable event. Rather than keeping that backlog in one contiguous buffer (where
 * every partial write costs an O(n) erase of the sent prefix, and every message
 * costs a copy into it), the queue is a chain of chunks:
 *
 *      chunks_:  [ sent | pending ] → [ pending ] → [ pending ]
 *                        ^ head_.sent
 *
 *   - pop_front() after a send just advances a cursor and drops whole chunks: O(1)
 *     amortised, no memmove.
 *   - append(Bytes) takes ownership of a buffer someone else already built, so a
 *     message the caller allocated (an encrypted frame, a piece read from disk) is
 *     never copied.
 *   - gather() exposes the chain as a slice list for writev()/WSASend(), so a
 *     backlog of N queued messages leaves in ONE syscall instead of N.
 *
 * Three things keep small messages cheap, since a chunk-per-message would otherwise
 * mean a malloc per 5-byte keep-alive:
 *   - copy-appends are packed into the spare capacity of the tail chunk
 *     (libtorrent's allocate_appendix), so a burst of small messages costs one
 *     allocation, not one per message;
 *   - the last fully-sent small chunk is kept and re-used, so a steady drip of
 *     small messages settles into allocating nothing at all;
 *   - the chain itself is a std::vector + a head index, not a std::deque. A deque
 *     allocates a fresh block every `block_size/sizeof(Chunk)` push_backs (libstdc++:
 *     one per 16 chunks; MSVC: one per *chunk*, since its block holds a single
 *     element for any type over 8 bytes) — so the recycled chunk above would hand
 *     back the payload buffer while the queue kept mallocing the slot to put it in.
 *     A vector amortises the slots away entirely, and re-uses its storage across
 *     drains.
 *
 * Memory is accounted two ways: size() is what still has to go out, while
 * allocated() is what the chain actually holds — larger, because a partially sent
 * chunk keeps its whole allocation and a packed chunk keeps its spare room. A
 * send high-water mark should watch allocated(): that is the memory a peer who
 * stops reading can make us carry.
 *
 * Not thread-safe: owned and touched by exactly one reactor thread.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   buf.append(std::move(frame));                       // queue, no copy
 *   ByteView slices[kMaxSendSlices];
 *   const size_t n = buf.gather(slices, kMaxSendSlices);
 *   const auto sent = send_vectored(sock, slices, n);   // one syscall
 *   if (sent > 0) buf.pop_front(size_t(sent));          // O(1)
