 * @file receive_buffer.h
 * @brief Stream receive buffer: O(1) consume, amortised growth, automatic shrink.
 *
 * A byte stream arrives in arbitrary slices and is parsed in whole messages, so a
 * receive buffer must hold a partial message across reads while handing complete
 * ones to the parser. Three cursors describe it:
 *
 *      |<-- consumed -->|<------ live ------>|<----- writable ----->|
 *      0             start_                end_                   cap_
 *
 *   - `consumed` — already parsed; dead space, reclaimed by compact().
 *   - `live`     — received but not yet parsed: data()/size().
 *   - `writable` — free tail, handed to recv() by prepare().
 *
 * consume() only advances `start_`, so dropping a parsed message is O(1) — the
 * point of the class (std::vector::erase() would be O(n) per message). Draining
 * the buffer rewinds both cursors to 0, so the steady state needs no memmove at
 * all; a memmove only happens when the tail runs out with a partial message still
 * live, i.e. at most once per bufferful.
 *
 * Memory:
 *   - Storage is raw, *uninitialised* (`new uint8_t[]`), not a std::vector: recv()
 *     overwrites it anyway, so value-initialising every byte is pure waste. It is
 *     also allocated at exactly the requested size, without the hidden ~2x
 *     over-allocation std::vector::resize() performs when it grows.
 *   - Growth is geometric (1.5x), so filling the buffer stays amortised O(1)/byte.
 *   - The buffer shrinks by itself: a running average of recent demand (the
 *     `watermark`) is sampled whenever the buffer drains, and once the allocation
 *     is more than twice that average it is reallocated down. Without this, one
 *     large message would pin a large allocation for the connection's lifetime.
 *     "Demand" is what prepare() was asked for, not merely what arrived — a caller
 *     reads with a fixed chunk size, so an allocation too small to serve the next
 *     read is not idle memory, and counting only the bytes that turned up would
 *     shrink the buffer just for the next prepare() to grow it straight back.
 *     (This mirrors libtorrent's receive_buffer watermark — which samples
 *     max(recv_end, packet_size) for the same reason — but as a plain exponential
 *     average instead of a 20-sample sliding window.)
 *
 * Not thread-safe: like everything on the connection path, it is owned and touched
 * by exactly one reactor thread.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   ByteSpan into = buf.prepare(16 * 1024);        // room for at least 16 KiB
 *   int n = recv(sock, into.data(), into.size());
 *   buf.commit(n);                                 // n bytes are now live
 *   while (auto msg = parse(buf.data(), buf.size()))
 *       buf.consume(msg.size());                   // O(1)
