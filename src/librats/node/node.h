/**
 * @file node.h
 * @brief The public entry point: a thin facade that wires the layers together.
 *
 * Node owns the reactor pool, the security provider, the peer table and the
 * message router, and it IS the ConnectionDelegate the reactors report to. It is
 * deliberately thin — it composes the layers and exposes a small async API; the
 * logic lives in those layers, not here.
 *
 * Threading: connect/send/broadcast are non-blocking and thread-safe — they post
 * work to the owning reactor. Event callbacks (on_peer_connected / on(channel,…)
 * / on_peer_disconnected) run on a reactor thread; register them before start().
 *
 * ── What a bare Node does, and what it does NOT ──────────────────────────────
 * A Node on its own is just the secure transport core. Out of the box it gives you:
 *   - an encrypted transport (Noise_XX, or plaintext per NodeConfig::security),
 *     with a self-certifying PeerId and the app protocol bound into the handshake,
 *     over EITHER wire: TCP, or the library's reliable stream over UDP. Both are
 *     offered by default on the same port, and a dial tries the preferred one
 *     (UDP, the better fit for P2P) and races the other after a short delay;
 *   - manual dialing: connect(host, port) / connect(Address) — it never discovers
 *     peers by itself;
 *   - the peer table + admission limit: peers(), peer(), peer_count(), max_peers;
 *   - raw channel messaging: send(to, channel, bytes) / broadcast(channel, bytes)
 *     / on(channel, …);
 *   - peer connect/disconnect events and the node-scoped EventBus + ServiceRegistry;
 *   - host network-change detection (NetworkChanged on the EventBus), if enabled;
 *   - identity persistence (NodeConfig::data_dir → identity.key).
 *
 * Everything else is an opt-in Subsystem you attach with add_subsystem() BEFORE
 * start(): peer discovery (DhtDiscovery, MdnsDiscovery), pub/sub (PubSub), typed
 * JSON messaging (MessageJson), file transfer (FileTransfer), liveness
 * (PingService), NAT port mapping (PortMappingService), automatic reconnection
 * (ReconnectionService), distributed storage (StorageManager). None of these are
 * wired by default — a bare Node neither discovers peers nor reconnects on its own;
 * the application composes exactly the capabilities it wants. This is deliberate:
 * the node stays a small, predictable core, and you pay only for what you attach.
