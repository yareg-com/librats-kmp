/// The default is the ordinary dial: three Syns at a doubling 500 ms timeout, so a
/// path that swallows UDP gives up in about three and a half seconds and the dialer
/// falls back to TCP promptly.
///
/// A hole punch wants the opposite shape. There the FIRST Syn is expected to die on
/// the peer's NAT — its job is to open our own mapping and filter — and what
/// actually connects is a later one, sent after the peer's Syn has crossed ours. So
/// a punch trades the long patient tail for a dense burst: more attempts, closer
/// together, no backoff. Everything else about the stream is unchanged; this only
/// governs the Syn, and once a stream is connected its timeout comes from measured
/// round trips as usual.
