/**
 * @file observer.h
 * @brief One outstanding query to a single node.
 *
 * An Observer is both the RPC callback the RpcManager invokes when a reply or
 * timeout arrives, and the little bag of per-node state (id, endpoint, flags) the
 * issuer tracks. It is owned via shared_ptr by whoever started the query (a
 * Traversal); the RpcManager holds a shared_ptr only while the query is in flight,
 * and takes a local copy across each callback so an observer can't be freed in the
 * middle of handling its own reply (e.g. if the traversal truncates it meanwhile).
 *
 * Observers reference their Traversal by plain reference, never owning it, so there
 * is no ownership cycle to untangle.
