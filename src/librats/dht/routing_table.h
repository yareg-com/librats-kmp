/**
 * @file routing_table.h
 * @brief A Kademlia routing table with libtorrent-style dynamic buckets.
 *
 * Pure in-memory state — no sockets, no locks. It lives entirely on the DHT actor
 * thread, so it never synchronises. It also never sends anything itself: liveness
 * pings are issued by the owning Node, which reports the outcome back through
 * node_seen() (it replied) / node_failed() (it timed out). That keeps the table a
 * testable data structure and the I/O in one place.
 *
 * Buckets are an ordered list rooted at our own id: buckets_[0] is the *farthest*
 * region of the keyspace and buckets_.back() the *closest* catch-all. When the last
 * bucket overflows and a split would actually separate its contacts, a new bucket is
 * appended and the contacts re-homed. Buckets near the top are larger (the extended
 * routing table) because that is where the keyspace — and the first hop of almost any
 * lookup — is densest, so more contacts there means fewer hops.
 *
 * Each bucket holds a *live* set — the contacts we route with, up to its size limit —
 * plus a small *replacement cache* of standbys promoted the moment a live contact
 * dies. Contact quality (RTT, failures, BEP 42 verification) lives on the NodeEntry
 * and drives who gets kept, refreshed, or evicted, while a sub-prefix "spread" rule
 * keeps a full bucket covering as many sub-branches as possible.
 *
 * Sybil/eclipse resistance (BEP 42). Admission is IP-diversity limited so no single
 * operator can pack the table with contacts it controls and hijack lookups:
 *   1. at most one contact per IP across the whole table, and
 *   2. at most one contact per /24 (IPv4) or /64 (IPv6) within any single bucket.
 * Only *public* addresses are constrained — private/loopback/CGNAT IPs can't be the
 * source of a real Sybil attack and would wrongly collide on a LAN (this mirrors the
 * BEP 42 exemption already applied by verify_node_id_for_ip). A per-IP count index
 * (ip_count_) makes rule 1 an O(1) check; rule 2 is a small per-bucket scan.
