/**
 * @file node_entry.h
 * @brief A single contact in the routing table: who it is, where to reach it, and
 *        the liveness/quality bookkeeping that decides who to keep or evict.
 *
 * Quality model (mirrors libtorrent's node_entry):
 *   - rtt        — smoothed round-trip time; kRttUnknown until the first reply.
 *   - fail_count — consecutive failed queries; kNeverPinged means we've only ever
 *                  *heard about* this node (from someone else's reply) and never had
 *                  a reply from it ourselves.
 *   - verified   — its id is derived from its IP per BEP 42, so it's harder to spoof
 *                  and is preferred when we have to choose who to drop.
