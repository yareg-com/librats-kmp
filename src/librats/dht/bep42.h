/**
 * @file bep42.h
 * @brief BEP 42 — deriving a DHT node id from a node's external IP.
 *
 * Binding the id to the IP stops a node from freely choosing where it sits in the
 * keyspace, which is the basis of the DHT's Sybil resistance. The first ~21 bits of
 * the id are a CRC32C of the masked IP plus a one-byte seed (stored in the last id
 * byte); the remaining bits are random. Only publicly routable IPs are constrained —
 * private/loopback/reserved addresses can't be verified and are exempt.
