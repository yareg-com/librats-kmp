/**
 * @file session.h
 * @brief Post-handshake symmetric session: encrypts/decrypts transport frames.
 *
 * A Session is produced by a Handshaker once the secure channel is established.
 * The Connection holds it and runs every outbound frame through encrypt() and
 * every inbound frame through decrypt(). The plaintext mode supplies a
 * passthrough Session so the Connection code path is identical with or without
 * encryption — no `if (encrypted)` scattered through the hot path.
