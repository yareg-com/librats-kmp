/**
 * @file reactor.h
 * @brief Single-threaded I/O reactor owning a shard of connections.
 *
 * A Reactor runs one thread that drives an IOPoller and owns every Connection
 * assigned to it. ALL connection state lives behind this one thread, so the
 * data path has zero locks. Other threads interact with it only by:
 *
 *   - post(task)    — run a closure on the reactor thread (wakes it);
 *   - execute(task) — same, but runs inline if already on the reactor thread;
 *   - connect()/close() — convenience wrappers that post the right task.
 *
 * The single synchronisation point is the MPSC task queue plus a WakeupPipe to
 * interrupt the poll wait. Timers (handshake timeouts, backoff) ride on the same
 * loop via a TimerQueue that also sizes each poll wait.
 *
 * A ReactorPool (see reactor_pool.h) runs N of these and shards connections
 * across them; with N == 1 this is a classic single-threaded reactor.
