/**
 * @file reconnection.h
 * @brief Keeps connections to a set of peer addresses alive with backoff.
 *
 * A Subsystem that remembers peer addresses (optionally persisted via PeerBook)
 * and re-dials them when they drop, using exponential backoff. Built only on
 * PeerNetwork: it dials via connect() and, each tick, reconciles its targets
 * against the set of currently-connected peers (PeerNetwork::peers(), whose
 * addresses include the dialable endpoints learned via identify). A target whose
 * address is served by a live peer — over ANY route, inbound or outbound — is
 * left alone; only the rest are dialed. Reconciling against this snapshot, rather
 * than trusting a flag toggled on the connect event, is what stops us from
 * endlessly re-dialing a peer already connected over a link we did not initiate
 * (an inbound link, or a cross-connect the directory resolved to the other side).
 *
 * A target is dropped when the app calls remove(), or — if Config::max_attempts
 * is set — after that many consecutive failed dials without ever connecting (it
 * "gives up", freeing memory and pruning the store). A successful connection
 * resets the attempt counter, so only persistently-dead addresses are reaped.
