/**
 * @file store_buffer.h
 * @brief In-RAM cache of blocks whose disk write is still in flight.
 *
 * When a block is handed to the disk for writing it is also parked here, keyed
 * by (piece, offset within piece). A read or hash issued before that write
 * reaches the platter is then satisfied from RAM by overlaying these bytes onto
 * whatever the disk returned — so the engine never reads stale data for a block
 * it has already accepted. The entry is dropped once the write completes.
 *
 * Thread-safe: writers insert/erase from disk-worker threads while readers
 * overlay; all access is guarded by an internal mutex.
