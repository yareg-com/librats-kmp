/**
 * @file tracker.h
 * @brief Tracker announces (BEP 3 over HTTP, BEP 15 over UDP) and the per-torrent
 *        announcer that drives them.
 *
 * A tracker is a directory: you periodically POST your progress and it hands back
 * a list of peers. The wire work is blocking (a short HTTP request or a two-step
 * UDP connect→announce), so announce_to_tracker() is a self-contained blocking
 * call with no shared state — easy to test and safe to run off-thread.
 *
 * TrackerAnnouncer is what a Torrent owns: it fires announces to every tracker on
 * background threads and delivers discovered peers back through a poster (onto the
 * reactor), exactly like the disk subsystem. stop() joins any in-flight announce
 * so a torrent never tears down underneath one.
