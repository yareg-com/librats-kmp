/**
 * @file piece_picker.h
 * @brief Decides which blocks to request next — the download strategy core.
 *
 * The picker tracks, for every piece: how many connected peers have it
 * (availability), our download priority for it, whether we already have it, and
 * — for pieces in progress — the per-block state machine
 * (None → Requested → Writing → Finished). pick_blocks() turns all of that into
 * a concrete list of blocks to ask a given peer for, honouring:
 *
 *   1. partial pieces first  — finish what's already started;
 *   2. the active strategy   — rarest-first (default), sequential or random;
 *   3. end-game              — once every needed block is already in flight,
 *                              re-request outstanding blocks from other peers.
 *
 * pick_blocks() is a pure query: it never mutates state. The caller commits its
 * choices with mark_requested(), so the two-queue request pipeline (reserved vs
 * in-flight) stays in the peer connection. Owned by one torrent on the network
 * thread — not thread-safe by design.
