/**
 * @file peer_book.h
 * @brief Persistent address book of peers worth reconnecting to.
 *
 * Records every peer we have successfully connected to (and addresses we have
 * learned), with light metadata: when we first/last saw it, when we last
 * connected, how many times, and the current consecutive-failure streak. One
 * ranked store serves BOTH needs at once — the "reconnect to recent peers"
 * working set and the "remember everyone we ever met" archive. Callers query
 * best() for the most promising addresses and rely on prune() to age out the
 * long tail.
 *
 * Time is passed in (unix seconds) rather than read here, so the book stays a
 * pure, testable data structure; the wall clock lives at the call site.
 *
 * Thread-safe. Backed by a human-readable JSON file: an array of objects, one
 * per record, e.g.
 *   [
 *     {"ip":"127.0.0.1","port":4001,"id":"ab..","first_seen":1000,
 *      "last_seen":2000,"last_connected":2000,"connect_count":2,"fail_streak":0}
 *   ]
 * The "id" field is omitted for peers we have only ever seen, never connected to.
