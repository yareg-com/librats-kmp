/**
 * @file peer_table.h
 * @brief Control-plane registry: PeerId → route + metadata.
 *
 * This is the only shared peer structure in the redesign, and it is deliberately
 * **off the per-byte data path**: it is touched on connect/disconnect and on
 * explicit by-id lookups (send-by-id, peers()), never per inbound/outbound frame
 * (those use the route carried in the Connection/Peer handle). It is therefore
 * read-mostly and guarded by a shared_mutex with short critical sections — a
 * world away from the old global peers_mutex_ held across recv/send.
