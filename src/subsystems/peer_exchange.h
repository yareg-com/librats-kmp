/**
 * @file peer_exchange.h
 * @brief Peer exchange (PEX): peers gossip the addresses of peers they know, so a
 *        node bootstraps the mesh from its existing links — no DHT/tracker needed.
 *
 * A Subsystem built purely on PeerNetwork. This first cut is deliberately
 * **pull-only**: when we connect to a peer we ask it for some of its known peers,
 * and it replies with a random sample (address + id). We then dial the ones we do
 * not already have. Both sides must run PeerExchange — the responder needs it to
 * answer the request.
 *
 * It rides on the node's identify layer: identify is what fills in each peer's
 * dialable address (an inbound peer's listen port is otherwise unknown), and PEX
 * simply forwards those addresses on. A discovered peer we dial becomes an
 * outbound link, so — paired with ReconnectionService — it is then persisted and
 * kept alive automatically.
 *
 * Wire format (MessageType::Pex payload), all integers big-endian:
 *   Request  : [u8 ver=1][u8 op=0][u16 max]
 *   Response : [u8 ver=1][u8 op=1][u16 count] × { [u8 ip_len][ip][u16 port][32B peer_id] }
 *
 * Safety: response size is capped both sides; the receiver bounds how many it
 * dials per response and de-duplicates dials with a TTL'd cooldown set (so a slow
 * dial or a repeated response can't trigger a connect storm); malformed payloads
 * are ignored, never fatal. `public_only` restricts sharing to globally-routable
 * addresses for WAN deployments that must not relay private/LAN endpoints.
 *
 * Threading: handlers run on reactor threads (possibly several with a multi-reactor
 * pool), so the cooldown set is mutex-guarded. The subsystem owns no thread.
